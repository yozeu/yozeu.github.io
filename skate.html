            <p>
                When everyone is included, everyone wins. Our goal is to create a website for Unity Skate Shop that well serves our client and involves the community. We also will create an enjoyable and informative experience for all the customers who want to buy products from them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a developer of this project. The main task for me is to develope the home page, about us page, and product page. Due to this pandemic, Our team could only have the meeings online, and dicuss through the message. This became a small issue for us to get the information between client and us.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Target</h3>
            <p>
                Creating a functional and informative website that is easy to navigate so customers can access without difficulty and understand what services they provide.
            </p>

            <p>
                Creating a function on the website where the owners are able to ship products and add to their inventory as well. The website should be visually appealing, and it should inform users of community events. 
            </p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <h4>Communicating frequently</h4>
            <p>
                Scheduling and communication may be an issue, as teams usually run into conflicts surrounding these obstacles. Another obstacle could be completing work on time.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Evaluation and final prototype</h3>
            <p>
                We got user input from our website through a survey which our team members created. We found out that our website was easy to navigate and visually appealing to the eyes. We had some classmates take the survey and new potential users as well to try and get their feedback which we certainly did receive and implement into our design.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stage was the most important part of the project because everything that we worked on was being put on display for our classmates to see as well as new users. We received great feedback from all of the users and got an idea of how satisfied users were with our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                After doing some final touches, we were ready for the website to go live. Down below are images of what the finished website looks like.

            <p>
                Communicating is the key. But the difficulty and time investing to learn a new language can be quite challenging. Translation boots up the convenience of communication right now, but so far there aren’t any translating site can perfectly interpretate other language’s slag, sentence, and wording. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was part of an ambitious project to redesigned, improved, and promoted the iTour Translator User experience for the ever first app that came out with the functions of facetime, phone call, live chat, documents, dialogs, meetings translation. All in one app.
            </p>

            <h3>Set off the Target</h3>
            <p>
                When the iTour Translator first launched, it was still in its alpha stage, monthly revenue was $10-30. In six months since 2021, iTour’s revenue has increased exponentially to earn $4000 monthly. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The translating app-designed in 2017, struggle to unstable customers alongside with the instability functions. Fundamental usability was challenged. By setting off the target customers foster the USP iTour can focus on.
            </p>

            <h4>The app is now growing globally.</h4>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <h4>Capture the user preference in 3 months</h4>
            <p>
                Our goal for the project is to let everyone communicate without any barriers. And can be done in every way they can/ can’t think of just through their electronic products. We aim to create the unprecedented that embraced all the existing translation unique selling proposition and build up our own
            </p>

            <p>
                Our high level goals are to:
            </p>
            <ol>

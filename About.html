            <h2>HI, I’M ZOE</h2>
            <p>
                I’m currently an IT junior student at UW Tacoma. I used to major in Computer Science, but decided to get in IT to get more focus on information assurance and cyber security.

                Currently, I am in the second quarter of my junior year. In these two quarters, I have worked as a web developer for two projects. <a href="https://unitysshop.wixsite.com/my-site">Unity Skate Shop</a> was developed by WIX and <a href="https://alex-k-s.github.io/KippersKlippers/index.html">Kippers Klippers</a> was developed by HTML. Also, I worked with a team and promoted a new launched translation app—<a href="https://www.itourtranslator.com/">ItourTranslation APP</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I was born in Taiwan and went to the United States to study when I was 17. Singing and dancing are my favorite. I like to record a part of song and upload it on a singing app.
            </p>
